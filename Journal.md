Description: "This Arduino project is a smart entry system that counts people using IR and ultrasonic sensors,
              displays data on an I2C LCD, and controls a servo gate. It includes push buttons to toggle system activity 
              and reset the gate with a 10-second pause and countdown. It's ideal for managing entry in controlled spaces."
